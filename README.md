## Abstract

A Facial expression contains A person's affective state, and it
is made of Facial expression is observable indications of a
person's affective state, cognitive activity, intention,
personality, and psychopathology, which serves as a
communication function in interpersonal relationships. Natural
human-machine interfaces could benefit from automatic facial
expression recognition. It could potentially be used in
behavioral science and therapeutic practices. An automatic
Facial Expression Recognition system must perform tasks such
as face detection and location in a chaotic scenario, facial
feature extraction, and facial emotion classification.

Facial expression recognition system is implemented using
Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN). DCNN model of
the project is based on Lent Architecture. Kaggle facial
expression dataset with seven facial expression labels as happy,
sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral is used in this
project. The system achieved 71% accuracy and 69.9 precision
on testing dataset.
